["CSI 3105", "Design and Analysis of Algorithms I (3 units)", "Analysis of algorithms: worst-case analysis, complexity analysis, asymptotic notations and basic complexity classes. Algorithm design techniques: brute force, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking. Computational complexity of problems: lower bound arguments, the classes P, NP, NP-complete, dealing with NP-complete problems.\nCourse Component: Lecture"]
